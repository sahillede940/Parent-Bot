  "description": "In the previous chapter, we have discussed team games \nlike Football, Hockey, Basketball, Cricket and Volleyball.  \nThis chapter includes Kabaddi, Kho-Kho and Combative sports like Judo and Wrestling.\nKabaddi\nKabaddi is an indigenous game which is popular in India. \nIt is a simple and inexpensive game and does not require a big playing area or any equipment. This game is popular in the villages and small towns in India. It is played throughout Asia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the other parts of the world. It was known by various names in different parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudu-gudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kit-kit (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in western India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of attack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves of a field and take turn in sending a \u2018Raider\u2019 into the other half. In order to win points, members of the opposite team are tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the breath and chanting, \u201cKabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi\u201d.\nFig. 7.1: Children playing kabaddiTeam Games  \nand spor Ts II\n7\nChap-7.indd   111 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X112\nHistory\nAccording to some historians Kabaddi might have developed \nduring prehistoric times when human beings were forced to defend themselves from sudden attacks from ferocious beasts. There is also another school of thought, in India, which believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha, used in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the first time at the international level during 1936 in Berlin Olympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal , Amravati, \nMaharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938. \nIn 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into \nexistence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After formation of the AKFI, the first men\u2019s nationals were held in Madras (Chennai), while the women\u2019s were held in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was founded in 1978. AKF is affiliated to Olympic Council of Asia. The parent body designated to regulate the game at the international level is International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then in 2007 and 2010. So far India is the unbeaten champion in Kabaddi World Cup. Iran is the next most successful nation being runners-up twice. Pakistan was the runners-up  \nin 2010.\nRules\nKabaddi field measurements\nS.

Traditionally the game is played outdoors and the entire court is dug at least 1 foot deep. The mud is removed and filled with sand from the river or beach. This ensures that the player is not seriously injured if he falls or is dragged by opponents. However, now synthetic Kabaddi fields are used for comfort and to reduce injuries. Tournaments like the Indian Kabaddi league have emerged as crowd pullers in urban areas.\nTeam\nEach team shall consist of minimum 10 and maximum 12 \nplayers. Seven players shall take the ground at a time and the remaining players are the substitutes.\nDuration of the match\nThe duration of the match is divided into two halves of 20 \nminutes each.

The teams shall change court after interval. The number of players for each team at the start of the second half shall remain the same as it was at the end of first half. The last raid of each half of the match shall be allowed to be completed even after completion of the scheduled time as mentioned above.\nChap-7.indd   113 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X114\nSystem of scoring\nOne point score will be given to each team for every opponent \nwho is deemed out.

The raider will not be awarded bonus points if they cross the bonus line after a touch or struggle.\n \u2022There shall be no revival for bonus points.\n \u2022If player is suspended temporarily or disqualified from the match, then the team will play with less number of players.

Dress code is followed compulsorily by both the teams during competitions.\n \u2022Application of oils or any other soft substances to the body shall not be allowed.\n \u2022Shoes are compulsory in case the match is played on the mat surface.\nFundamental skills\nSkills\nThe skills used by the raider in kabaddi are called offensive \nskills. The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills. During a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his limbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to score points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such as, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with lower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs.\n  Offensive skills\n a) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest \nskill, which every raider applies in one or the other forms. There are different kinds of touches such as \u2014\n (i) Hand touch: (a) running hand touch  \n(b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch (d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch\n (ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by \nalmost every raider. A raider can execute this \nChap-7.indd   115 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X116\nskill even from a considerable distance from \nthe anties. During the course of a raid, the raider will move in different angles, according to the positions and moves of the opponents. At the same time, in order to apply this skill, the raider requires to extend his leg towards the opponent suddenly. \n (iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a \nmoderate form of foot-touch. The major difference between these two skills is that in foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the opponents with complete foot whereas in toe touch, toe is used to touch the opponents. This skill helps the raider to cover more area in the opponent\u2019s court and has an advantage over toe touch.\n b) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations. \nMule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the raider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various types of kicks, such as \u2014 \n i. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind \nthe raider during the course of raid is known as back kick. The different forms of back kick are: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back kick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and back kick.\n ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to \nsecond and attack the central zone will find this skill the most suitable. The method and principle of kick are the same as in the case of back kick. The only difference between the two is that the area to be covered is sideward.\n iii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the \nleg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve from back to the side. This type of kick will enable the raider to cover more area with the attacking leg. At the same time it enables the raider to change his direction. \n  Defensive skills\n a) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by \ndefensive players against leg thrusts and foot touches during an attack or raid. A team, which has mastery over ankle hold, can plan different strategies and tactics in various situations, such as, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing direction of the raider.\nChap-7.indd   116 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs II117 b) Thigh hold: This skill is a good defensive skill. \nEvery team uses this technique as a planned \nand surprise tactic. For example: (a) Taking one step forward and hold \u2014 Taking one step forward means holding the raider\u2019s thigh on wrong step or rear leg (b) thigh hold from behind.\n c) Waist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used \nby a defender to catch the raider from behind.\n d) Wrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and \nused occasionally only when a situation presents itself. This hold is rarely used now a days.\n e) Blocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers \nand corners. Blocking is an act of creating a wall of obstruction in the path of the raider to prevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not  \njust to obstruct the path, but also to catch  \nthe raider.\nTactics\nTactics means exploiting a given situation to one\u2019s advantage. \nThis is also done to create a situation to suit one\u2019s purpose. The raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game depending on the situation. In order to do this the player may adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a situation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time in the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team is leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game. Keeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted by the raider.\nRetreat\nUnless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid, \nthe raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a retreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before starting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider should keep the following points in view \u2014\n \u2022The raider does not give room for pursuit.\n \u2022The raider regains their defensive position quickly before the opponent team\u2019s raider begins the raid.\n \u2022While returning to home court, the raider must pass only through the midline.\nRaid\nRaid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of \nthe game is raiding on the opponent\u2019s court, alternatively by both the team players. The defence is done with teamwork while only one player makes an attack.\nChap-7.indd   117 8/24/2020   11:41:01 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X118\nCant\n\u2018Cant\u2019 is holding of breath by the raider during the attack \nand chanting the word kabaddi, kabaddi, respectively, in one single expiration. \nKho-Kho\nKho-Kho is one of the most popular traditional team sport in \nIndia. It is the simplest form of chasing and touching a person. It is an inexpensive and enjoyable sport that demands physical fitness and a set of skills. Dodging, feigning and bursts of controlled speed make this game quite thrilling. To catch by pursuit is to chase, rather than just run \u2014 is the main skill of Kho-Kho. This game is played in two innings by two teams on a rectangular court. One team becomes the chasers and the other the runners. In the game, the chaser pursues the runners and touches them and puts them out. Each team has to chase and defend for 9 minutes twice in a match.\nFig. 7.3: Player playing kho-kho\nHistory\nIn the ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played on \u2018raths\u2019 or chariots in Maharashtra, and this was known as Rathera. The Kho-Kho rules were first framed in the early 1900\u2019s. A committee was formed at Puna Gymkhana in 1914 for framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first ever book of Kho-Kho rules was published from Baroda Gymkhana in 1924. The year 1936 was the year of the golden opportunity for the game of Kho-Kho when Berlin Olympic Games featured an exhibition of Kho-Kho in the main stadium. The Hanuman \nVyayam Prasarak Mandal of Amravati was the proud demonstrators in that exhibition.\nThe first ever All India Kho-Kho Championships were \norganised at Vijaywada in 1959-60 under the auspices of Kho-Kho Federation of India. In 1969-70 the junior age group \nChap-7.indd   118 8/24/2020   11:41:03 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs II119competitions were organised in Hyderabad. Competitions for \nwomen\u2019s junior-group, girls under 16, were held in 1974 at Dewas when two more sub-junior groups for  boys under 14 and for Girls under 12 also commenced. In the tournament best sub-junior boys were awarded Bharat Award and best sub-junior girls Veer Bala Award. In 1987, a demonstration was held in South Asian Games and Asian Kho-Kho Federation came into existence with three countries as its members.

In the term judo, \u2018ju\u2019 means \n\u2018gentle\u2019 and \u2018do\u2019 means \u2018the way or path\u2019.  \nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th century by using the principles of balance and leverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or putdown one\u2019s opponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise subdue one\u2019s opponent with a grappling maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or by executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense are a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either for participation in competition or self-defense.\nHistory\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was \ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the techniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the more dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was a recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in 1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan\u2019s educational system. In the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors\u2019 Training Department, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan Athletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different development of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was being taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando and special services training often achieved a high standard of expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo was given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals awarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one silver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had \ndeveloped to become an international sport. \nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the \nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories. Earlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, if two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man \nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later this was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic Games in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.  \nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the Olympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style practice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice becomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress on skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them instinctive and the development of speed through practice with little resistance. \nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\nChap-7.indd   122 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs II123Rules\nOfficials\nThere are three officials who preside over a judo match. There \nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and conducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally across the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two judges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant goes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge of awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand gestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees with a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision is decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and Referees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is usually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties and it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel are also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. \nContestants\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for \n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant wears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. \nUniforms\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, \nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up of loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around the waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They are either blue or white and they are made so a rival should be able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able to make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other blue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around the waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the combatant has reached. \nCompetition area\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square  \n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats \ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual mats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter wide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which is 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in color, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will have a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is the danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that they are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the danger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide and it is the out-of-bounds area.\nChap-7.indd   123 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X124\nIn the middle of the contest area are two pieces of tape, \none blue and one white 13.1 feet apart (4-meters). These two \npieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand when they begin and end each bout.\nContest\nA random draw, in the same weight category, is used to \ndetermine which contestants will be fighting each other. In the Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has its own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners will compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest winning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who lose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round which is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of the repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals.\nTo win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score \nthat equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques. If neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10 points by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka who has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the first time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the \u201cGolden Score\u201d rule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute period has ended, the referee announces the beginning of \u201cGolden Score\u201d. This will extend the match for an extra five-minute period and the contestant who scores the first point is declared the winner of the match.\nJudo penalties\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and \nanother is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third shido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not result in expulsion from the tournament. \nWrestling\nConsidered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the \nworld, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is a form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, such as, traditional, historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.Activity 7.1\nWhat is the proficiency \ngiven in India? Make a list.\ne.g.: Yellow belt or Black \nbelt. \nChap-7.indd   124 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs II125\nFig. 7.6: Bout in wrestling\nHistory\nWrestling has been a part of human society since ancient \ntimes. In India also it received regular patronage from the Emperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly known as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata, \nBhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time and some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, Duryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana also mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described as one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India continued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even during the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging support, as the British rulers included the game into the military practice. In fact, India was considered among the top 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted the World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a \nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti is composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and \npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may be similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi \npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves known as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But what is significantly different about wrestling in India is that wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts that last for half an hour or more. At other times and under other circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined international guidelines, rules, and regulations.Do You Know?\nIn 2008, Sushil Kumar \nbrought 2nd Bronze Medal for India at Beijing Olympic Games. This feat was repeated at 2012 Olympics games by Sushil Kumar (Silver Medal) and Yogeshwar Dutt Bronze Medal. The first medal was won by K.D. Jadhav in 1952 at Helsinki Games. Geeta Phogat became the first Indian woman wrestler to represent the country at 2012 London Olympic Games.\nChap-7.indd   125 8/24/2020   11:41:05 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X126\nWorldwide wrestling entered a new era with the \nacknowledgement of Female Wrestling as an Olympic \ndiscipline in the Athens Games in 2004. \nMeasurement of the wrestling mat\nTerms Dimensions\nDimensions of the mat 9 meters in a circle\nEmpty space on the border of the mat 1 metre\nHeight of the platform 1.10 metre\nColour of marks on the mat Red of Blue\nThickness of the mat 10 cm\nProtection area 1.2 to 1.5 m width\n1.5 m7 m\nCentral\nwrestling\narea1 m1 m\n12 m\n12 mProtection area\nPassivity\nzone\nFig. 7.7: Specifications of wrestling play area\nRules and regulations\n 1.

Once the line of the back area breaks a 90-degree angle, points are scored. This can occur both from the feet and on the mat. A wrestler who holds his opponent in a danger position for five seconds will receive one extra point.\n \u2022Reversal is, when the man underneath completely re-verses his position and comes to the top position in control, he has scored a reversal, worth one point.\n \u2022Escape is when an athlete works to come out from the bottom position (after being under dominant control) and gets to their feet, facing the rival.
