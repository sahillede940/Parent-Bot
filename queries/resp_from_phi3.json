However, considering the information given about extracurricular activities and their general purpose within schools, it can be inferred that such opportunities likely exist in the school's program:\n\n1. Clubs: Monthly book club meetings for different age groups could potentially encourage social interaction, discussions, and sharing of ideas among students.\n   \n2. Group Study Rooms: These rooms are often used collaboratively by students to study together, fostering teamwork skills and communication amongst peers.\n\n3. Sports Teams/Activities: Schools usually offer various sports teams or activities which inherently require cooperation, sportsmanship, leadership, and other social skills development opportunities among children.\n\n4. Performing Arts Activities (Drama Club, Music Band etc.): These provide students with a platform to express themselves creatively while developing teamwork, public speaking abilities, empathy, and resilience in the face of critique or failure.\n\n5. Service Clubs (Peer mentoring programs, volunteering initiatives): Participating in such clubs can teach children compassion, leadership skills, cooperation, and problem-solving abilities while interacting with peers.\n\nRemember that these are inferred possibilities based on typical extracurrraphic activities offered by schools, but for detailed information, it would be best to contact the school directly or check their website/annual report if available. \n\nThe RAG bot can effectively inform parents about various opportunities and resources provided by the school that promote social skill development among children. By mentioning these extracurricular activities, the RAG bot can demonstrate how schools encourage students' holistic growth beyond academic achievements, fostering essential life skills like teamwork, leadership, empathy, resilience, public speaking etc. This information is crucial for parents to help their children make informed decisions about engaging in these activities and supporting their overall developmental journey."
