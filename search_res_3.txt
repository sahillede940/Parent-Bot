Besides these, yet another regional institute, known as North-Eastern Regional Institute of Education (NERIE) is located at Shillong.\n 5. NCERT: Role in Health and Physical Education NCERT \nas an apex body includes functioning of Health and Physical Education like all other subject areas. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF-2005) prepared by NCERT considers health and physical education a compulsory subject from Class I to X and optional subject at Classes XI and XII. As a follow up of NCF-2005, NCERT has prepared syllabus on health and physical education which has been approved by the National Steering Committee set by the Government of India. Health and Physical Education components have also been included in the pre-service training courses running at each RIE\u2019s. It contributes to the policy formulation process of the Central and State governments related to Health and Physical Education.\nCBSE\nCentral Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is the first board of education that was set up in 1921 under jurisdiction of Rajputana, Central India and Gwalior. Government of India decided to set up a Joint Board in 1929 and it was named as the \u2018Board of High School and Intermediate Education. Later in 1952, the constitution of the Board was amended and it was named as \u2018Central Board of Secondary Education\u2019. In 1962 the Board was reconstituted once again with the objectives: (i) to serve the educational institutions \nChap-13.indd   216 8/24/2020   12:27:35 PM\n2024-25\nAgencies  And AwArd Promoting  HeAltH, sPorts And YogA217more effectively (ii) to be responsive to the educational \nneeds of those students whose parents were employed in the Central Government and had frequently transferable jobs. The major functions of the CBSE have been to develop curriculum for all the subjects at the secondary and higher secondary levels, to conduct evaluation and examination activities, to organise teacher training workshops, to develop resource materials for teachers and students, to publish some text books for secondary and senior secondary classes and to monitor various academic projects. The CBSE has been preparing syllabi on Health and Physical Education, conducting competitive sport activities for schools affiliated to it and promoting the transaction of Health and Physical Education at secondary and higher secondary levels. It has also been ensuring that the Comprehensive and Continuous Evaluation (CCE) is focused on health and physical education activities. \nSchool education agencies in states\nWe have found that there are government agencies at the state level for preparing curriculam, training teachers and other functionaries and evaluating the performance of students. There is a State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) in almost all the major States. This institution is responsible for preparation of syllabi and textbooks for all the classes at primary and upper primary stages. In some of the States and Union Territories, the State Institutes of Education (SIE) or the Directorates of Education perform these roles. All these institutions at the state level perform these roles for the subject area of Health and Physical Education also. Then there are State Boards of Education, that are responsible for preparation of Syllabi and textbooks and evaluation of students of all classes at secondary and higher secondary stages. These institutions also conduct in-service teacher training for all the subjects including the subject of Health and Physical Education. Under SCERTs there are District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) that are responsible for pre-service teacher education at the elementary stage (primary and upper primary stages).\nSAI \nSport Authority of Indi a (SAI) was set up by the Government of \nIndia in 1984, aimed to promote sport in India and developing excellence by upgrading the skills of the Indian sport persons. Some of the prestigious institutes run by the SAI are:  \n(i) Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sport, (Chandigarh, Sonipat, Lucknow, Guwahati, Imphal, Bangaluru, Madurai, Kolkata, Patiala and Gandhinagar), and (ii) Laxmibai National College of Physical Education (Thiruvananthapuram).

Another ambicious schemes run by SAI are - Special Area Games (SAG), and Centre of excellence (COX), producing high level National/International sport.\nNSNIS\nAfter independence, on May 7, 1961 the National Institute of Sport (NIS) was set up by the Government of India for the development of sport at the Motibagh Palace of the then Maharaja of Patiala. With the objective of developing sport in the country on scientific lines and to train the coaches in different sport disciplines.
