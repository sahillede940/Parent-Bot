  "description": "A team game means organised physical activity with players \nworking together towards a shared objective. In team games a group of individuals in the same team, work together to achieve the objective of being the winners of the game. Team members set points and scores, make decisions, communicate among themselves, manage conflicting situations, and solve problems in a supportive, trusting atmosphere in order to achieve their objectives. Team games include games, such as, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi, Kho-Kho and Volleyball, etc. In this chapter, we shall discuss Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey and Volleyball. \nBasket Ball\nFig. 6.1: Children playing basketball\nBasketball is a fast, free-flowing, high-scoring team game. The players shoot a ball through a basket to score points while following a set of rules. Usually, two teams consist of Team Games  \nand spor Ts I\n6\nChap-6.indd   77 8/24/2020   11:39:22 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X78\nfive players on each team. They play on a marked rectangular \ncourt with a basket fixed on each end. Basketball is one of the world\u2019s most popular games.\nThe rules allow all players to move freely around the \ncourt and occupy any position. All players have an equal opportunity to score a Basket. To play basketball, students should learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling, passing, receiving and shooting.\nHistory\nThe game of basketbal l originated at the Springfield \nCollege of Physical Education, Massachusetts, USA in \n1891, invented by Dr. James Naismith. In 1894, Naismith fixed the first 13 rules which still form the basis of modern basketball. In India, the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for the first time. Later the YMCA established at Madras in 1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order to promote Basketball at National and International levels the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The first National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in 1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until \n1951. After that it started bei ng organised annually. \nBasketball court measurements\nFig. 6.2: Basketball court, a basket and a basketball28m\n15m1.575m0.90m SidelineThrow-in line\n8.325mThreePointLine0.15m\n6.75mNo-chargeSemi-Circle3.6m\nCentreCircle\nEndlineCentre lineRestricted\nAreaEndline\nSideline\nBasketball is played on a rectangular court, which should be an indoor wooden court or an outdoor concrete court having two side lines and two end lines. The dimensions of basketball court is 28 x15 meters. The court is divided \n18 inch\nwide Diameter\nChap-6.indd   78 8/24/2020   11:39:23 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I79into two sections, called half-courts, by the mid-court line, \nwhich is where the game starts with a jump ball. A jump ball is when a referee throws the ball up at center circle to determine which team gets possession. Two players from opposing teams jump up to tap the ball out of the circle in order to gain control over the ball take the game forward. The basketball posts are located at the opposite ends of the court.\nRules\nDuration of a Match (Total 4 Quarters)\nPlay Rest Play Half time Play Rest Play\n10 min 2 min 10 min 15 min 10 min 2 min 10 min\n \u2022The duration of the game of each quarter is ten minutes with 2 minutes rest between 1st and 2nd quarter and 3rd and 4th quarter, also 15 minutes rest between 2nd and 3rd quarter. Extra time period is of about 5 minutes. Teams exchange the side after half time. The clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, it takes longer time to complete the game than the allotted time.\n \u2022A team must consist of twelve (12) members. But \nonly five players from each team may be on the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when the play is stopped. \n \u2022The team with the ball, attempting to score in their basket is \u2018on offense\u2019, the team that prevents opposite team from scoring is \u2018on defence\u2019. The ball is moved in two ways: either dribbling or by passing to teammates. If the ball goes out of the court, the ball possession is given to the opposite team. \n \u2022For both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible bib number, printed on both the front and back. Players should wear appropriate shoes that provide extra ankle support. \n \u2022The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the three (3) referees, out of which one (1) is the overall incharge and the other four (4) table officials are responsible for keeping other records of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player substitutions, alternating possession arrow, and stop\u2013and-go-clock, etc.\n \u2022The essential equipment in basketball game is the ball, clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows and other required equipments.\n \u2022An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent \nthrough physical contact is illegal and called a foul. \nChap-6.indd   79 8/24/2020   11:39:23 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X80\nPlayers who are fouled either get ball possession or \nare awarded one or two free throws and one point is awarded for successfully converting a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket. Each player is allowed 5 personal fouls before they are disqualified from the game. At this point they no longer remain a part of the game.\n \u2022Two points are awarded when a basket is scored during the game but three points are awarded when a basket is scored from outside the 6.25 mtrs line. \nFundamental skills\nWe are well aware that, to play any game one has to learn some skills. Similarly to play basketball game a player should learn the following fundamental skills. \nDribbling\nIt is important to penetrate to score a basket, move the ball across the court, get away from the defenders, and find a good passing lane. There are different types of dribbling \u2014 \n \u2022basic dribble\n \u2022low dribbling\n \u2022high dribble\n \u2022behind the back\n \u2022crossover dribble \n \u2022change-of-pace\n \u2022between the legs dribble\nPassing\nA good offensive attack requires accurate passing from players. It helps find an open man, to find a good shooter or to get away from a defender. There are several types of passes used in basketball, either one hand or both hand pass \u2014\n \u2022Overhead \n \u2022Chest \n \u2022Push \n \u2022Baseball \n \u2022Off-the-dribble \n \u2022Bounce \n \u2022Shoulder \n \u2022Hook \nFig. 6.3: Dribbling\nChap-6.indd   80 8/24/2020   11:39:24 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I81Fig. 6.4: Passing\n18 inch\nwide Diameter\nShooting\nFig. 6.5: Shooting\nThe objective of the game is to win by scoring maximum \npoints.

Here are examples of the three basic categories of team defences. In addition, each category comprises of an assortment of different variations.\n \u2022Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match up the defenders against specific offensive players. Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with offensive players by size and ability.\n \u2022Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named or designated by their player alignments.\n \u2022Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be \ndeployed is the combination defence. With combina-tion defences, some of the players are assigned to play man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. \nRebounding\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession \nof the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defence tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.\nChap-6.indd   82 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I83\nFig. 6.7: Rebounding\nArjun awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1.

One team bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many runs as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by the batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman hitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end of the pitch and touching the crease there without being dismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at the end of an inning.\nChap-6.indd   83 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X84\nHistory\nThe game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the \nsouth eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. The Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750\u2019s had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became an international game with the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial Cricket Conference was changed to International Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the common wealth to become its members. The first Limited Over International cricket match was played in 1971 at Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket world cup won by West Indies. \nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, \nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international match took place on August 5 2004, between the women\u2019s teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 international match between men\u2019s teams was played on February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The first T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under \nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The national championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji of Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket. \nMeasurement\nMin 122cm\nMin3.66 m 2.64 m 3.05 mReturn Crease\nStumps\nBowling Crease\nPopping Crease\n20.12 m (22 yds)\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\nChap-6.indd   84 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I85Ways to score runs\nThe aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main \ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must run to the pitch at each other\u2019s end (from one end to the other), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman hits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both are scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary after touching the ground it is considered as four and if the ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is considered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman by running between the wickets are null and void. \nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket \nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters.\n \u2022A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the \nheel of the bowler\u2019s front foot lands on or in front of the popping crease or if the bowler\u2019s back foot touches then outside the return crease the ball is declared no ball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen\u2019s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a No ball except if they are run out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself.\n \u2022A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the \nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen\u2019s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be declared \u2018out\u2019 off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field.\n \u2022A Bye is where a ball that isn\u2019t a no ball or wide passes \nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.\nChap-6.indd   85 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X86\n \u2022A Leg Bye  is where runs are scored by hitting the \nbatsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball \nor wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn\u2019t attempt to play a shot or if he was avoiding the ball.\nTypes of \u2018out\u2019 in cricket\nWays batsmen can be given \u2018Out\u2019 according to cricket rules:\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a \u2018wicket\u2019. Following are the different ways, a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket:\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\n \u2022Bowled \u2013 Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman\u2019s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman\u2019s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets.\n \u2022Caught \u2013 Cricket rules state that if a batsman while playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n \u2022Leg before Wicket (LBW) \u2013 If the ball is bowled and \nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire \nChap-6.indd   86 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I87need to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball \nhave hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his, answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out.\n \u2022Stumped \u2013 A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\n \u2022Retired Out \u2013 A batsman leaves the field without the permission of umpire for any resource like, illness, injury etc. Than is given as retired out. \n \u2022Run Out \u2013 Cricket rules state that a batsman is out \nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side.\n \u2022Hit Wicket \u2013 Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in play then he is out. \n \u2022Handled the Ball \u2013 Cricket rules allow the batsman \nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition or umpire.\n \u2022Timed Out \u2013 An incoming batsman must be ready to \nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given timed out.\n \u2022Hit the Ball Twice \u2013 Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition, he is out.\n \u2022Obstructing the Field \u2013 A batsman is out if he intentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are \nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play.\nIf any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire\u2019s \nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, he may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out is considered a dismissal.\nChap-6.indd   87 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X88\nRules\n \u2022Cricket is a game played between two teams consisting \nof eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a twelfth man, who can only be utilized as fielder.\n \u2022The twelfth man is not allowed to ball, bat, and wicket keeping or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder.\n \u2022Two umpires are placed on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of video decisions.\n \u2022When the call is too close for the on field umpires then they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow motion video replays to make a decision.\nFundamental skills\nBatting skills\nBeing a batsman he must have good wrist power, eye co-\nordination, Endurance, speed, Excellent reaction ability and Statistics for cricket.\nFig. 6.10: Batting skill\nChap-6.indd   88 8/24/2020   11:39:30 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I89Batting techniques\n\u2022\tDefence  \u2022\tDrive\n\u2022\tPull \u2022\tCut\n\u2022\tHook  \u2022\tSweep\nFront foot defence\n \u2022The front foot defence is played when the ball is bowled \nat a good length, which is not over-pitched enough for a drive and not short enough to go on the back foot. \n \u2022The front foot should move as close as possible to the pitch of the ball with the left shoulder and left elbow leading the body in the direction of the ball.\n \u2022The weight of the body is on the front foot with the knee bent and the head should be over the bat watching the point of contact. The bat is kept angled and very close to the front pad to prevent the ball going through bat and pad. \n \u2022The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the bottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index finger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should be fully extended with the heel raised off the ground but remaining parallel to the crease.\n \u2022The weight of the back foot should be on the inside of the right toe and care should be taken not to turn it or drag it out of the crease. \n \u2022The front foot defensive stroke can be played with the bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend-ing on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency of the bowler. \nOff drive\n \u2022Off drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with the off stump or marginally outside. \n \u2022Like the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow lead the body with the front foot going as close as possible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down in and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the ball just in front of the left foot. \n \u2022After impact, the bat must continue in the arc and finish over the left shoulder. The follow through can also be checked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open. \n \u2022The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot and the top hand and elbow controls the direction of the shot. At the time of impact the head should be over the ball with the body weight balanced on the front foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and on \ncompletion, the batsman must be well balanced. \nChap-6.indd   89 8/24/2020   11:39:30 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X90\nStraight drive\n \u2022This shot is played exactly in the same way as an off \ndrive but with the difference is that it is played to a over pitched ball in and around the line of middle stump and the front foot must point down the wicket and the body must be turned slightly and the shoulders opened out to allow the f ree swing of the bat. \nOn drive\n \u2022On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around \nthe leg stump. \n \u2022This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play. The basic principles of a drive apply here too, though the swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on with the front pointing down the wicket. \n \u2022The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball with the shoulders turned and the impact is just in front of the left toe. The follow through is generally checked below shoulder height.\nBack foot defence\n \u2022The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short-\npitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not \nshort enough to play and attacking shot.\n \u2022The back foot is moved back and across to the line of the ball with the front naturally following it. The bat is brought down close to the body with the head steady and over the ball. \n \u2022The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as far as possible to maintain the sideways position of the body with the top hand firm and in control, and the bottom hand holding the bat loosely.\n \u2022To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high next to the head. Care should be taken to maintain the balance at the time of playing the ball and to remain \u2018side-on\u2019 as this presents a smaller target for short rising deliveries. \n \u2022The back foot defence can also be played with the body beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman must resist the temptation to follow the movement of the ball away fr om him. \nBowling skills\nBowling is as important as batting. The ball is defended by \na batsman to save his wicket. When the ball is bowled to a batsman it is called as a ball or delivery.\nFig. 6.11: Bowling Skills\nChap-6.indd   90 8/24/2020   11:39:31 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I91Types of bowling\nFast bowling Spin bowling\nSeam bowling Off spin\nSwing bowling Leg spin\nBouncer Chinaman\nIn swinger Doosra \nLeg cutter Googly\nOff cutter Arm ball\nSwing bowling\n \u2022When a ball of a fast or medium fast bowler deviator in \nair either on leg side (in swing) or on off side (out swing) it is turned in air as swing bowling.\nOutswing\n \u2022For out swing bowling, the ball is held with the index and middle finger and thumb below the seam, which is upright & angled towards the slips with the shiny surface on the right (for right hand bowler).\n \u2022For effective out swing bowling, the bowler should bowl as close as possible to the stumps.\n \u2022The wrist is cocked and when the ball is released the seam must be vertical and goes down the pitch upright. The two fingers should stay behind the seam as long as possible. \nInswing\n \u2022Here, the ball is held by the two fingers and the thumb underneath it, with the seam upright and angle towards fine leg. \n \u2022The shiny side is on the left side and the fingers may also have a slight gap between them.\nWicket keeping\nThe wicket keeper plays an important role in cricket. \nA good wicket keeper can save a number of runs for his team.  \nHis function is to stop deliveries, which the batsman is unable to play or passed by batsman.\nFielding\nIn 21st century, fielding is a key point to win the match.  \nA player requires more hard work, practice and flexibility to \nbecome a good fielder.\nFig. 6.12: Wicket keeping\nChap-6.indd   91 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X92\n3rd Man\nLeg SlipsFine leg\nSlips\nGully\nPoint\nCover Point\nCover\nExtra Cover\nMid offMid onMid WicketSquare Leg\nBowlerWK\nDeep\nSquare\nDeep\nMid Wicket\nDeep Extra\nCover\nLong off Long on\nFig. 6.13: Fielding\nArjuna awardee\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1 Sachin Tendulkar 1994\n2 Sourav Ganguly 1997\n3 Rahul Dravid 1998\n4 Mithali Raj 2003\n5 Anju Jain 2005\n6 Anjum Chopra 2006\n7 Jhulan Goswami 2010\nChap-6.indd   92 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I938 Virat Kohli 2013\n9 Harmanpreet Kaur 2017\n10 Smriti Mandhana 2018\nBharat Ratna\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1. Sachin Tendulkar 2013\nFootBall \nFootball has been a very popular game all over the world \nsince ages. Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game \nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. It is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a goal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected at the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the ball to an opposing team\u2019s end of the field and putting it between two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball by kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that scores more points than the other by the end of the match wins the game.\nHistory\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football Association), the \u201cvery earliest form of the game was played in china during the second and third centuries. The game was later developed in England and the rules of football were formulated in India, football began its journey when the British rulers brought it with them and in no time it became popular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place between the \u2018Calcutta Club of Civilians\u2019 and the \u2018Gentlemen of Barrackpore\u2019 in 1854. The first ever football club in India, the \u2018Calcutta Football Club\u2019 was founded in 1872. The first football association, \u201cthe Indian Football Association\u201d (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as the country put up commendable performances in a number of international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\n68-70 cm\nCircumference\nof football\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of \nfootball\nChap-6.indd   93 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X94\nFig. 6.15: Children playing football\n90-120m\nHalfway Line\nCentre CircleCentre Spot\nRadius\n9.15mPenalty Area\nPenalty\nSpotGoal AreaGoal45-90m Goal LineRadius9.15m\n40.3m\n16.5m11m\n5.5m16.5m\n7.32m2.45m\n10 yds\nFig. 6.16: Specifications of football ground\nField measurements\nAs per international standard, the length of the rectangular \nfootball field (pitch) is in the range of 100 to 110 m (110 to 120 yards) and the width is in the range of 65 to 75 m (70 to 80 yards). There are also goal posts at the back of each football zone. One way to score is to kick the football through the goal posts. The ball must go between the uprights and over the crossbar. \nChap-6.indd   94 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I95Goal post\nDistance between the posts is 7.32 meter whereas the height \nof the goal post is 2.44 meter.\nRules\nAccording to the official rules of football guide, the players \nneed to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The football match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. There are several rules in the game of football regarding the \nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence. \nStart and restart of play\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of \nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At the kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own halves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot in the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it \nagain until another player has made contact.\nPunishment for offences\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee \ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution is shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads to Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means that player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no previous caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such as, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately handling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying a goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or gestures.\nFree kicks\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite \nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. There are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the nature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick \u2014 allows the team to take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free Kick \u2014 a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a second player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to \nscore a goal.\nPenalty kick\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the \npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is allowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line until the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be outside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the \nChap-6.indd   95 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X96\nplayer has taken the kick, that player cannot strike the ball \nagain without another player touching the ball.\nThrow-in\nA throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch \nline (conceded by the team who last touched the ball). It is delivered on the field of play with both hands and from behind and over the player\u2019s head. Otherwise it is deemed to be a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It cannot go directly to the goalkeeper\u2019s hands (if on the same team). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\nCorner kick\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal \nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players. A kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball travelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from the corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second time without having touched by any other player.\nFundamental skills\nReceiving\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a \nball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive the ball, don\u2019t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, shot, dribble, pass.\nPassing\nPassing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision \nmaking is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,  \nsee the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding the head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with lacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of weight forward.\nShooting\nShooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the \ndifference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to convert the score for the team. Player should look up to see the position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the ball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper follow through.\nTrapping\nIt is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses \nthe feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground.\nChap-6.indd   96 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I97Techniques and lead-up activities\nThe students already learnt the fundamental techniques of \nplaying football in the previous classes. Now let us discuss a few lead-up activities to develop these techniques.\nBall control\nFive versus two in 30m x 20m area. Players make two touches \nonly to retain possession of the ball. \nDribbling\nFour quarters of the area are numbered. One player dribbles \nin one quarter and passes the ball to quarter number 2 and so on. Reaching last quarter, the player without losing the ball gets points. If ball is lost in any quarter, the other teams start anti clockwise and then enter in to the next three quarters. \nPassing\nNumber of players\u2014four. Rectangle measures 5m \u00d7 20m or \n10m \u00d7 30 m, one ball.\nHeading\nTwo versus two, Goal of 8 yards, Centre line 5 yards from \neach goal.\nShooting\nShooting board is a place along the penalty spot, arranged \ninside the penalty area. \nTackling\nOne versus one, 10m \u00d7 10m area, time 2 minutes. \nThrow-ins\nThrow-in is a competition between two players.\nGoal keeper\nA goal keeper also acts as a defence but is allowed to catch \nor touch the ball with hands within the penalty box (D-area). A goal keeper is usually the last man standing at the goal to prevent opponents from scoring the goal. \nArjuna awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1 P.K. Banerjee 1961\n2 C.P.

However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries in which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another form of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey. The players should learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn how to attack and score goals and how to work with others to defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they need to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively and moving the ball accurately and quickly between players. As they progress, skills should become more consistent and efficient, and the players should be introduced to set play situations. \nFig. 6.17: Players playing hockey\nHistory\nThe history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the world\u2019s early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the hockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years before the Ancient Games of Olympia. Right from Arabs, Greeks, Romans, and Persians to Ethiopians, every country played with a variation of the game. While some played it just \nChap-6.indd   98 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I99for recreation, the others had the opinion that hockey would \nmake them better warriors. Even though many ancient civilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern game of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the 19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army regiments and the game soon became popular. It was during this time that the London Hockey Association was formed and the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and three years later, the International Federation of Women\u2019s Hockey followed.\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in \n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making its Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian hockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding a single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was the wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who mesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the golden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of the finest players the game has ever seen.\nField measurements\n91.40 m\n55 m22.9 m\nCentre line\n22.9 m\nPenalty Spot22.9 m\n14.63 m\n6.4 m\n5.5 m5 m\nFig. 6.18: Specification of hockey field\nChap-6.indd   99 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X100\nHockey is played on a 91.40 m \u00d7 55 m rectangular field.  \nAt each end there is a goal 2.14 m high 1.20 m deep and \n3.66 m wide measured from the inner sides of the posts and crossbar, and the goal post is surrounded by an approximately semi-circular area 14.63 m from the goal bounded by a solid line. A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty  \nspot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of each goal.\nEquipment\nEach player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90 centimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made of wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening out on one side and with a hook at the bottom.\nRules\nThe rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH are used worldwide.\nGeneral play\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the \nwinning captain can choose a starting end or start with the ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each quarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field.\nField players may only play the ball with the flat side \nof the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or his stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the ball from a legitimate tackle.\nWhen the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to \nplay from sideline either by individual player by himself or with a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched by an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any player of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded for offenses committed by the attacking side within  \n15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking. \nFree hits\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside \nthe scoring circles. The ball may be hit or pushed once in any direction by the team offended against. Opponents \nChap-6.indd   100 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\nTeam Games and sporTs I101must move 5 mt away from the ball when a free hit is \nawarded, and for attacking free hits within 5 mt of the circle, \nall attackers other than the one taking the hit must also be 5 mt away. \nCorner\nA corner is awarded if the ball goes over the backline after \nlast being touched by a defender. Corners are played by the attacking team and involve a free hit from the 22.90  \nmeter line.\nPenalty corner\nThe penalty corner is set play that is awarded against \na defending team when any offence is committed in the defensive circle, and may be awarded when a deliberate offence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the defending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line. \nPenalty stroke\nA penalty stroke is awarded when defenders commit a \ndeliberate foul in the circle which deprives an attacker of possession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty is being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper, and is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with heels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball is played. \nOn the umpire\u2019s whistle, the striker may push or flick the \nball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The player taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice. Hitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with 15 mt hit to the defenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre line. Time is stopped for the Penalty stroke.\nDangerous play\nIf the ball is raised off the ground in a manner that is, in the \numpire\u2019s opinion, dangerous, the ball is turned over to the other team and they receive a free hit from the point of contact. \nTie breaker (shootout)\nIn case of a draw match, penalty shootout is conducted. \nThe winners will be decided by 5 penalty shootouts by each team and the team which scores highest number of goals is declared the winner. The shootout will start at 22.90 mt. line in front of the shooter and should be completed within 8 seconds after the umpire\u2019s whistle. The goalkeeper will start defence from goal line.\nChap-6.indd   101 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\nHealt H and PHysical  education  - class X102\nArjuna awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1 Prithipal Singh 1961\n2 Sunita Puri 1966\n3 P.

Each team works together \nto hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to score points by grounding the ball on the other team\u2019s court. Volleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch the ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential for the player to be in the right place at the right time if the game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore,  \ngood anticipation and movement skills should be taught to players. At competency level, students should learn and practice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over a high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games working as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on the opponent\u2019s side of the court.\nHistory\nOriginally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor sport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic effort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net was borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above the average man\u2019s height. During a demonstration game, someone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps \u201cvolleyball\u201d would be a more descriptive name for the sport.
